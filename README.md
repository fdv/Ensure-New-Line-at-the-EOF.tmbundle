# Ensure New Line at the EOF

TextMate 2 bundle: Adds new line at EOL if missing in current document when saving. Inspired by [Strip Whitespace On Save by Ale Muñoz](https://github.com/bomberstudios/Strip-Whitespace-On-Save.tmbundle).

## Installation

- Clone the git repo to  `~/Library/Application Support/Avian/Bundles`
- Relaunch TextMate 2

## Notes

**You need to be using at least TextMate version 2.0.0-alpha.9317**. Open Preferences » Software Update and **ALT-click the "Check Now"** button to get the most recent nightly build (this will grab a latest version than the one you get by just clicking the button).

Enjoy it!
